# ⚖️ Sales Dashboard Application

This is a React application with two distinct dashboards to visualize and analyze sales data.Each dashboard should present both graphical and tabular data, categorized by product and category.

* This project is made using React, Chart.js, AG Grid and React Router.

* In this application I am using mock data to achieve the functionality.
